# SWE-Bench Parallel Validation Work Log

## Overview
Implementing parallel validation system for 500 SWE-Bench instances using GCP workers to achieve high-throughput validation with proper Python version handling.

## Session: 2025-08-10

### Problem Analysis ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Root Cause Identified**: psf/requests instances failing at 0% rate due to Python version mismatch
- Epoch AI images have correct Python versions (3.9 for requests) in conda environments
- Original tester used `conda run -n testbed pytest` ‚Üí system Python 3.11
- Caused `ImportError: cannot import name 'MutableMapping' from 'collections'`
- Also `TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'strict'`

### Critical Fixes Implemented ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### 1. Python Interpreter Fix
- **Before**: `conda run -n testbed pytest`  
- **After**: `conda run -n testbed python -m pytest`
- **Impact**: Ensures pytest runs with conda environment's Python, not system Python

#### 2. Pytest Flag Fix
- **Before**: `pytest -v --tb=short --no-header -rN`
- **After**: `pytest -v --tb=short -rN` (removed `--no-header`)
- **Impact**: Eliminates immediate failures in older pytest versions

#### 3. Timeout Fixes
- **HTTP timeout**: 150s ‚Üí 420s
- **Test timeout**: 120s ‚Üí 300s  
- **Future timeout**: 180s ‚Üí 420s
- **Impact**: Prevents false negatives from network/execution timeouts

#### 4. Python Version Verification
- Added `verify_python_version()` function
- Logs Python executable path and version before tests
- Warns if psf/requests using Python 3.10+
- **Impact**: Better debugging and early detection of version issues

#### 5. Enhanced Pytest Installation Check
- Verifies pytest is installed IN the conda environment
- Checks pytest path contains `/envs/testbed/`
- Force reinstalls if found outside environment
- **Impact**: Ensures pytest module is available in correct environment

### Docker Image Creation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Image**: `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/king-ai-gpts-luka-dev/swebench/swe-bench-tester:v2-fixed`
- **Registry**: Artifact Registry in us-central1
- **Status**: Built and pushed successfully
- **Features**: All fixes included, Python version verification enabled

### Infrastructure Challenges üöß IN PROGRESS

#### Attempt 1: Metadata Update (FAILED)
- Updated metadata for existing 8 workers with robust startup script
- Initiated reboots for all workers
- **Issue**: Workers continued running old containers due to `--restart always`
- **Result**: Still seeing `conda run pytest -xvs` in logs instead of fixed version

#### Attempt 2: Fleet Recreation (PARTIAL)
- Destroyed original 8-worker fleet
- Created new fleet with startup script pulling v2-fixed image
- **Challenge**: Preemptible instance instability
  - Initial deployment: 6/8 workers preempted during creation
  - Current status: 3 workers potentially available
  - Workers: 34.59.30.169, 34.123.9.23, 35.238.177.176

### Infrastructure Challenges üöß RESOLVED

#### Attempt 3: Back to Basics - Local Build (SUCCESS)
**CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED**: Don't overcomplicate things we don't have to do.

**Problem Analysis**: 
- We got distracted trying to use Artifact Registry when local builds worked perfectly before
- Artifact Registry authentication added unnecessary complexity for no benefit
- **Our singular goal**: Get testing framework working on 100% of the 499 instances

**Solution**: Return to simple local builds on VMs
- **Before (worked)**: `git clone` + `docker build -t swe-bench-tester .` on each VM
- **Attempted (failed)**: Pre-built private registry image with authentication 
- **Now (works)**: Back to local builds with fixed tester code

**Key Insight**: Registry is better for long-term operations, but local builds are perfectly adequate for validation runs and remove all authentication complexity.

### Current Status - CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED ‚ö†Ô∏è (13:30 UTC)

**‚ùå MISSION NOT COMPLETE**: Still working toward 100% success rate

#### Phase 1: Python Interpreter Fix ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Python interpreter mismatch (system 3.11 vs conda 3.9)
- **Fix**: Changed to `conda run -n testbed python -m pytest`
- **Result**: Tests now execute with correct Python version

#### Phase 2: Infrastructure Fix ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Fixes weren't committed to git - workers got old code
- **Fix**: Committed changes, pushed to remote, workers now build from updated code
- **Result**: Workers successfully deploy with all fixes

#### Phase 3: Test Discovery Fix ‚úÖ  
- **Issue**: "file or directory not found: all" errors
- **Fix**: Handle test_files=['all'] as test discovery trigger
- **Result**: Tests execute without path errors

#### Phase 4: CRITICAL DISCOVERY - Wrong Tests Being Run ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **GPT-5 Analysis**: We're running ENTIRE test suite instead of just changed tests
- **Problem**: This introduces historical failures unrelated to the patch
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - `_collect_changed_test_paths()` - only run tests modified by patch
  - Auto-install missing fixtures (pytest-mock, pytest-httpbin)
  - NO fallback to test discovery - targeted tests only

**CURRENT STATUS**: 
- ‚úÖ Targeted test execution code committed and pushed
- ‚úÖ Worker redeployed with complete fix stack  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing in progress to verify 100% success rate

### Targeted Test Execution Implementation (13:40 UTC)

**What We Fixed**:
1. **`_collect_changed_test_paths()`** - Identifies test files modified by the patch using git diff
2. **Auto-install missing fixtures** - Automatically installs pytest-mock, pytest-httpbin, etc. when tests require them
3. **NO test discovery fallback** - Only runs the specific tests that were changed, never the entire suite
4. **Proper test file handling** - Converts test_files=['all'] to use only changed tests

**Next Steps**:
1. Test with real SWE-Bench instance to verify targeted execution works
2. Confirm 100% of modified tests pass WITH patches
3. Confirm 0% of modified tests pass WITHOUT patches  
4. Run full 500 instance validation once verified

**THE REAL GOAL** (per user clarification):
- **WITH patches**: 100% of tests should PASS (proving patch works)
- **WITHOUT patches**: 0% of tests should PASS (proving there was a bug)
- **Current approach**: Only run tests that the patch modifies - not entire suite

### Expected Results
Once infrastructure is stable:
- **psf/requests success rate**: 0% ‚Üí ~80%
- **Overall validation rate**: 57.79% ‚Üí 75-85%  
- **Full 500 instance runtime**: ~25-30 minutes
- **Python version issues**: Resolved for all repositories

### Next Actions
1. üöÄ Deploy new fleet with local build script (5-10 min total)
2. üß™ Test one psf/requests instance to verify Python fixes work
3. ‚ö° Run full validation of all 500 instances with fixes
4. üìä Achieve our goal: 100% success rate on testing framework

### For Future Readers
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT LESSON**: Don't go off doing things we don't have to do. We have ONE goal and ONE goal only: getting the testing framework to work on 100% of the 499 instances. 

Don't get distracted by "better" approaches that add complexity without clear necessity. Simple local builds work perfectly fine for validation runs.

### Technical Artifacts
- **Fixed tester**: `/runner/docker/tester/tester_service/tester.py` 
- **Worker config**: `/runner/src/worker_config.json`
- **Deployment scripts**: `/scripts/gcp/deploy_fixed_fleet.sh`
- **Test results**: `/runner/src/psf_requests_test_results.json`
